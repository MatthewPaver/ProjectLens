## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Do **not** rename the `projectlens\data\output` subfolders, or the connections may break.
- Ensure the required CSV or Excel files exist inside the updated `output` folder before refreshing.

If you encounter any issues, double-check your folder structure and try reloading the `.pbix` file.
